**Introduction** 

Welcome to MyTetris, a classic puzzle game reimagined with modern features and enhancements, all developed in Ruby! This version of Tetris introduces varying levels of difficulty, new and unique pieces, and more exciting gameplay elements.

**Features**

Multiple Levels: Progress through increasingly challenging levels.
New Tetromino Pieces: In addition to the classic Tetriminos, encounter new shapes and configurations.
Speed Variation: Game speed increases as you advance through levels.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your high scores and challenge yourself to beat them.
Smooth Controls: Enjoy responsive and intuitive controls.
Interactive Buttons: Can control aspects of the game such as pausing, new game, reseting, and all piece controls through interactive buttons if you would like to use those instead of the keys on your keyboard.

**How to Play**

The goal of Tetris is to arrange falling tetromino pieces into complete lines, which will then disappear, earning you points. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the screen and no more moves are possible.

**New Pieces**

In addition to the standard Tetris pieces, this version introduces:

Cheat Piece: At a cost of 100 points, you can create a single piece 1x1 piece
Box and Top: A randomly generated 2x2 square with a 1x1 on top
5x1: As titled, a randomly generated 5x1 line
Mini L: A mini L piece that fits snuggly into corners

**Controls**

Left Arrow or A: Move the piece left.
Right Arrow: Move the piece right.
Down Arrow: Speed up the falling piece.
Up Arrow: Rotate the piece clockwise.
Spacebar: Instantly drop the piece to the bottom.
P: Pause/Unpause the game.
Q: Quit the game.

**Difficulty**

Added a new dimension of difficulty to infinte tetris. As more pieces get progressively placed, the drop speed per piece will increment and get faster and faster.
The only way to reset and reduce the dropping speed per piece is to clear a complete row. Once deteced, speed gets reset and the user gets a little "time to breath".
